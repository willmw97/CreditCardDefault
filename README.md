**Executive Summary:**

This project is a website that takes inputs of personal financial information
like age, gender, cedit payments to calculate and then return a probability of how likely a user will default on there credit card the next month.

The data set used to create this was from the University California Irvine data sets.
The specific data set is from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients

**Data Set Information:**

This research aimed at the case of customersâ€™ default payments in Taiwan and compares the predictive accuracy of probability of default among six data mining methods. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. Because the real probability of default is unknown, this study presented the novel â€œSorting Smoothing Methodâ€ to estimate the real probability of default. With the real probability of default as the response variable (Y), and the predictive probability of default as the independent variable (X), the simple linear regression result (Y = A + BX) shows that the forecasting model produced by artificial neural network has the highest coefficient of determination; its regression intercept (A) is close to zero, and regression coefficient (B) to one. Therefore, among the six data mining techniques, artificial neural network is the only one that can accurately estimate the real probability of default.


**How to run?**

To run the project make sure all the necessary files are in the same directory.
Then run the python file called Import_model which will give a local URL
address to run in your browser for the website.
